<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project

This project is an attempt to recreate the 1975 Jet Fighter game. It's a game from old arcade machines, once popular in US arcades. Today, the flyer for this machine alone, worth $10-30, is a collector's item, and I don't know the price of the actual machine itself, as it's one of the rarest machines. The game features two planes (white and black), controlled by two players who play against each other. More information can be found <a href="https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8232">tutaj</a>. In my project, controls are performed using the A, D, and spacebar for the white fighter, and the < > arrow and enter keys for the black one.
